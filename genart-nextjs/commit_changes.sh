Restructure repository: move Next.js project to root level

Major folder restructuring to clean up the repository architecture:

â€¢ Moved all Next.js project files from genart-nextjs/ subdirectory to root level
â€¢ Moved legacy HTML files (index.html, index-basic.html, sketch.js) to legacy/ folder  
â€¢ Moved all Processing files (*.pde) to legacy/ folder for historical reference
â€¢ Updated GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/deploy.yml for root-level structure
â€¢ Removed the now-empty genart-nextjs/ subdirectory

This restructuring provides a cleaner repository layout with the Next.js project 
at the root level, while preserving all legacy implementations in an organized 
legacy/ folder. The deployment workflow has been updated to work with the new 
structure for seamless GitHub Pages deployment.
